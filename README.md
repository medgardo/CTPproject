# Untitled Project
### CUNY Tech Prep
#### Prepared For: "TA Name"

## Summary

The main goal for this application would be to create a "social media" platform for students and developers to find and share small open source projects to work on together. The application would provide a easy way to search and find projects to work on that fit your skill set. On the other side, it could be a place where you post a project you've been working on to invite others to join in.</p>
<p>For those who are new to programming it can feel intimidating trying to get involved in large open source projects. Furthermore, there are plenty of beginners who don't have a community around them to work on projects with or even ask advice on something they are already working on. This application would help those individuals feel empowered to help each other to create projects they are passionate about. </p>
<p>Something similar to this idea would be Github's explore page, where you can search through projects that are trending or showcased. The the difference would be that most of those projects are there because they are being used my many people, not necessarily because the owner of the project needs help working on it.</p>

## User Type & Use Cases

<p>The user for this application would be someone looking to work on or share an open source project. He or She would create an account, including some information such as on what programming languages they work in and their skill level. They could then make a post for a project they've been working on, making sure to include a github link to the project and details including a description, category, language, skill level, subject etc. Another user who maybe doesn't have any great project ideas yet but really wants to get involved with one could also make an account and search through by categories (language,skill,project subject) that make it easy to find something that they would be able to contribute to. </p>
